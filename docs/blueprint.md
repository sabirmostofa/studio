## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#5A7DA6) for a professional, trustworthy impression.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), providing a clean and neutral canvas.
- Accent color: Muted lavender (#A090B5), used sparingly for highlights and calls to action, avoiding clichés and overpowering brighter tones.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' sans-serif for headings and titles, giving an elegant and artistic touch. Body Font: 'Alegreya' serif, selected for longer chunks of text to improve readability.
- Use a clean, single-column layout for easy readability. Employ generous white space to avoid a cluttered look.
- Minimalist icons (if used) to represent sections such as Experience, Skills, and Education, sourced from a simple line icon set.
- Subtle transitions when the CV is loaded, such as a fade-in effect. Avoid overly complex animations.
